Then the fasta.gz files were all put together in a folder and decompressed using pigz to obtain fasta files for the next step of analysis.

## Dependences
The main dependences are snakemake, pigz and [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download).
You can create a environment using the **ncbi_download.yaml** file by:
